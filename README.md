# Dog breed detector

### About this project:

This project is my capstone project for Udacity's data science nanodegree. It consists in developping an algorithm that can detect dog breeds in dog pictures and return the dog breed looking the most like a human picture. The solution used to solve the problem is to develop a convolutional neural network with transferred learning from ResNet50. The different steps to get to that model can be followed along in the Jupyter notebook and this [blog post](https://medium.com/@julienflandre/creating-an-convolutional-neural-network-to-detect-dog-breeds-in-pictures-9adb9588930f).
